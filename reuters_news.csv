"SYDNEY/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Global regulators have held off approving the Boeing 737 MAX despite a decision by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to end a 20-month grounding, highlighting changes in the global regulatory pecking order caused by two crashes of the jet.,The announcements from East to West highlighted China's growing clout in aerospace and global affairs.,Now, however, the ungrounding process is expected to take days, weeks or longer as foreign regulators check the FAA's homework and impose their own conditions for a return to service.,In the past, regulators promptly followed the guidance of the FAA, credited for decades with pioneering aviation safety. But many are now wary of seeming to toe the FAA line after the U.S. agency was faulted for lax oversight.,Canada and Brazil, two aircraft-producing nations with heft in the industry, are expected to back the FAA's decision within weeks. But both said on Wednesday they weren't yet ready to decide.,""I think it's causing the countries to be a little bit more critical of the type-certificate validation process,"" said Mike Daniel, a former FAA certification expert and accident investigator based in Singapore. ""Hopefully they're a little bit more critical of what their air operators are required to do with regard to training."",The ability of regulators to co-operate is crucial in a sector spanning dozens of jurisdictions.,Having a regulator such as the FAA do the heavy lifting to certify a U.S. plane reduces costs and time, because agencies abroad can validate the results without having to duplicate them, said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia.,""What the FAA does need are more resources,"" he said.,It has been closely involved in vetting the MAX changes and is expected to have greater scrutiny of future projects like Boeing's 777X, while the FAA may do likewise with Airbus jets.,The crisis has boosted EASA's influence as some agencies wait for its decision on the MAX rather than copy the FAA.,""We have been working with EASA since the early days on the issue and their position will be taken into account,"" a spokesman for Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority said.,Industry sources say EASA could issue its ungrounding order as early as next week, followed by a 30-day comment period.,But there will be some differences between what the FAA approved and what Europe and Canada will require for their airlines. Canada, one of the last major nations before the U.S. to ground the MAX, has faced criticism for shadowing its ally.,'ARM IN ARM',FAA chief Steve Dickson played down the differences.,""There's very little daylight"" between the FAA and regulators around the world, he said, adding that the FAA had worked ""arm in arm"" with Europe, Canada and Brazil.,""As painful and as arduous as the process has been, it has really strengthened the cooperation between these regulators and I think it put us in a much stronger position globally for aviation safety going forward,"" he said. He expected other agencies to approve the MAX in a ""relatively short period of time"".,That still leaves unanswered questions over China's plans for approving the MAX. As the biggest operator, its decisions have an immediate impact on Boeing, and its broader airspace ban could hamper the return to service by other Asian airlines.,But as a rising aerospace power with its own commercial jet programme and ambitions to be taken seriously as a regulator, China has wider interests too, analysts say. Some do not exclude Beijing using the MAX as a political bargaining chip.,""We worry that it might be used as a tool in the escalating tensions between the U.S. and Chinese governments,"" Morningstar analyst Burkett Huey wrote. ""That noted, we are encouraged by the coming change in the U.S. government and think the new administration may have a less combative trade policy, which we think increases the chance of Chinese recertification.""",Middle East & Africa,2020-11-19,"Analysis: As regulators prepare to weigh in on 737 MAX, FAA's global dominance fades"

"(Reuters) - Target Corp blew past analyst expectations for quarterly profit and sales on Wednesday as more Americans used the retailer's quick-delivery services to buy everything from electronics to home goods during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Shares of the Minneapolis-based retailer hit a record high of $168.42 with a gain of about 3% in morning trading, adding to the 27% advance seen so far this year.,Comparable digital sales rose 155% in the third quarter, the company said, driven largely by same-day services like Drive up, Shipt or straight in-store pick ups, with more than 95% of sales being fulfilled through stores.,Target, which operates nearly 1,900 stores, has emerged as one of the big winners from the disruption caused by the coronavirus health crisis as investments in its private label and online business, including faster shipments, have paid off.,While people were making fewer trips outdoors, many who did venture out visited Target, raising its store traffic during the quarter. Bigger rival Walmart on Monday said it saw foot traffic fall, though U.S. e-commerce sales surged 79%.,""The investments we've made in safety and our team are being recognized, and they're rewarding us even during the pandemic with more and more trips to our stores,"" said Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said on a media call.,The retailer was also winning the loyalty of fresh customers, analysts said.,""It's clear that Target is not only gaining new customers but also retaining them, which will be critical as we move into 2021,"" said Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom.,Comparable sales, which include online and store sales, rose 20.7% in the third quarter ended Oct.31, trouncing expectations for an 11.31% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.,Electronics sales jumped more than 50%, while comparable sales for the home category were up in the mid-20% range.,Other categories that performed well in the quarter included home decor, intimates and sleepwear, men's apparel, food and beverage, toys, and beauty.,Earlier this month, Target said it struck a long-term deal with Ulta Beauty Inc to open the cosmetics store chain's stores at the retailer's locations.,The pandemic has forced retailers to bring forward their holiday promotions, casting a shadow over the traditional holiday shopping season from Thanksgiving to Christmas day.,""We expect this to be a season that's going to be very different, unlike any other we've ever seen. But we expect that guests will decorate their home, and there'll be gifts under the tree,"" Cornell said.,Retailers that have seen sales surge during the pandemic, including Target and Walmart, are grappling with how to restock shelves quickly with highly sought essentials, especially as COVID-19 cases are surging in much of the United States and across the world, spurring Britain and other countries in Europe, and many American states, to go into another lockdown.,Target, whose inventory of cleaning and paper products had taken a hit at the start of the health crisis, said it was making progress in these categories even though sales had not returned to pre-pandemic levels. It said it felt ""well positioned"" in all of its major categories heading into the peak of the holiday season.,Target's net earnings rose to $1.01 billion, from $714 million a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $2.79 per share, beating estimates for $1.60.,Total revenue surged 21.3% to $22.63 billion, beating estimates for $20.93 billion.",Retail,2020-11-18,Target beats estimates as same-day delivery boosts online demand

"SEOUL (Reuters) - Electric vehicles (EVs), benefiting globally from a push for tighter emissions controls, are facing challenges after a global string of fires from overheating batteries.,Here are some vehicle recalls and investigations facing major EV makers worldwide.,After 16 Kona EVs caught fire in Korea, Canada and Europe over two years, Hyundai Motor Co is expanding a recall to cover at least 74,000 of its top-selling EVs in South Korea, the United States, Europe and Canada to update its battery management system.,About 23,000 Kona EVs in South Korea have completed the software upgrade, with 800 of them found to have battery defects requiring replacement of affected modules, according to the office of lawmaker Jang Kyung-tae, which was briefed by South Korea's transport ministry.,Hyundai, in a filing to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in October, blamed ""internal damage to certain cells of the lithium-ion battery increasing the risk of an electrical short circuit."",The battery maker, LG Chem Ltd denied any cell defects, saying a joint investigation was under way.,General Motors Co said last week it was recalling nearly 69,000 Chevrolet Bolt EVs worldwide that pose a fire risk after five reported fires and two minor injuries.,Affected vehicles will get battery software updates, limiting charges to 90% of capacity.,In October, NHTSA opened a probe after reviewing reports of three Bolt EVs catching fire under the rear seat while parked. The probe covers 77,842 Bolt EVs from the 2017 through 2020 model years.,LG Chem is the supplier of the batteries.,In September, Ford Motor Co recalled 20,500 Kuga plug-in hybrid EVs in Europe and suspended sales over battery fire concerns. There had been seven fires but no injuries.,Ford offered to replace the entire battery pack, saying the root cause had been identified as a battery-cell contamination issue in its supplier's production process, which could cause ""serious consequences."",The Kuga setbacks forced the automaker to pool its fleet with other automakers to avoid a fine.

"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak asked a U.S. court on Tuesday for permission to seek documents and testimony from investment bank Goldman Sachs to help in his defence against criminal charges in Malaysia over the 1MDB financial scandal.,Najib, who is on bail after being sentenced to 12 years in jail in July on charges of corruption and money laundering, is expected to appeal the conviction in February and faces four more trials related to the scandal.,The U.S. Justice Department has said about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), which Najib co-founded in 2009, including some funds Goldman had helped raise for the firm.,In a court filing in New York, Najib said Goldman Sachs and its former Southeast Asia chairman, Tim Leissner, probably had evidence that 1MDB officials schemed to defraud the fund and were now falsely implicating him to avoid responsibility.,Najib added that efforts by Leissner and others to hide the money trail misled him to believe that 1MDB funds that went into his accounts were political donations from the Saudi royal family.,""This effort spanned continents and multiple jurisdictions, included the deployment of an array of shell companies, and involved numerous individuals,"" Najib said in the filing.,A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment, as did a lawyer for Leissner.,Goldman has agreed to pay more than $5 billion, including a record $2.9 billion in the United States, to settle investigations into its role in underwriting $6.5 billion in bond sales for 1MDB.,Leissner pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 2018.",Banks,2020-11-18,"Malaysia's Najib seeks to depose Goldman Sachs, ex-banker in 1MDB defence"
"(Reuters) - Just as the novel coronavirus was gaining a foothold in the United States in mid-March, Pfizer Inc Chief Executive Albert Bourla called on his top vaccine scientists and laid out a clear mission:,""He basically said, 'Your mandate is to get this vaccine made. And if you need resources, you come and you ask for them, and you're going to get them',""chief viral vaccine scientist Philip Dormitzer told Reuters.,The assignment was both inspiring and daunting. It provided researchers with the backing to tackle something that had never been done before: design a vaccine to stop a pandemic in its tracks in less than a year.,""He did not want us to focus on the potential barriers we might face, but instead said that it is much better to try to do something that seemed impossible, and even if you don't succeed, you still (will) have done something great, "" said Dormitzer, noting that new vaccine development can cost on the order of $1 billion.,What followed was a full-bore effort carried out under strict coronavirus lockdown conditions, borrowing elements from ongoing flu and cancer research, according to Reuters interviews with half a dozen scientists critical to the vaccine program run by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech SE. On Nov. 9, the companies reported the first promising results from large-scale, scientifically rigorous clinical trials around the world - although potential roadblocks remain and widespread distribution is not expected until at least April.,On Monday, Moderna Inc, a scrappy biotech with nearly $1 billion in research and development backing from the U.S. government, announced what appeared to be its own successful vaccine, using the same new technology that brought Pfizer such rapid results.,Both companies have reported preliminary findings of more than 90% effectiveness - an unexpectedly high rate - raising hope for an end to the pandemic that has killed more than 1.3 million people globally, upended economies and disrupted daily life for billions of people.,Their work validates that of several tiny biotechnology firms, which for years have been laboring to prove a once-unorthodox idea: The human body can act as its own vaccine factory. Both the Pfizer and Moderna inoculations work by injecting people with customized genetic code that instructs human cells to make key virus proteins to induce an immune response.,In Pfizer's and BioNTech's case, decision-making that normally would take months was reduced to days, including the crucial call on which vaccine version to use in a human clinical trial that has enrolled about 44,000 people worldwide so far.,In many ways, however, the work has just begun. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna still must finalize their data on efficacy and safety, and share that information with the scientific community and regulators - including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which will make the call on whether to authorize the vaccines for emergency use. The companies will have to increase production to as much as 2 billion doses or more by the end of 2021 - and face a massive task in distributing them.,Pfizer's Dormitzer is more prepared than many to meet the challenges, having led research efforts at Novartis AG in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. That project produced three licensed vaccines in the most rapid pandemic vaccine response until now.,At Novartis AG, Dormitzer began testing novel ways to make vaccines using messenger ribonucleic acid, or mRNA, which contains instructions for human cells. In this case, scientists introduce mRNA instructions for cells to make a portion of a virus, which the immune system recognizes as a threat and counters with a protective response. No actual virus is involved in the process.,By contrast, to create a typical vaccine, scientists use bits of dead or weakened virus, which are then injected to produce the immune response.,The appeal of mRNA vaccines - and a key secret to their speed - is they are plug-and-play: The mRNA vehicle does not need to change, only the specific genetic instructions it carries. If the virus changes or mutates, the details of the instructions can be altered accordingly.,At Pfizer, one of Dormitzer's colleagues, Julia Li, had been scouting for potential partners with mRNA technology for a few years. Li settled on a little-known German biotech firm called BioNTech that was using mRNA technology to make cancer treatments. The company was co-founded by Chief Executive Ugur Sahin and his wife, Chief Medical Officer Oezlem Tuereci.,""I originally wasn't that interested,"" Dormitzer said. ""Why would I look at an oncology company?"" he recalled. ""We're doing viral infectious diseases."",Li saw something more. BioNTech had mRNA production capacity, a solid team of scientists and a desire to start working on infectious diseases. ""We ended up going into Germany and meeting the folks at BioNTech,"" said Dormitzer.In August 2018, the two companies began work on an mRNA-based flu vaccine.,Already concerned about a possible coronavirus pandemic, Sahin decided in January that BioNTech should begin developing a vaccine, said Katalin Karikó, the company's senior vice president and one of the pioneers behind the mRNA technology. The CEO designed several of the vaccine candidates himself, she said.,Again, the companies proved to have complementary skills. ""BioNTech is a smaller company, more flexible,"" said Karikó. ""A big pharma, like Pfizer, has the infrastructure, knows how to scale up, how to run things."",In early March, the pair decided to expand their partnership, embarking on a coronavirus vaccine deal worth up to $750 million.,Both companies recognized that mRNA vaccines work very differently in animals compared to humans. For that reason, after doing preliminary animal studies to ensure vaccine candidates were safe, they pared back additional animal studies, which are aimed at identifying the single best candidate, and moved into human trials with several prototype vaccines.,In the spring, the drugmakers' first human trials began, starting with the phase 1 safety trials in Germany in April, followed by those in the United States in May. They tested four versions in all. The aim was ""to figure out in a quick, quick clip, what really was working best in people,"" Dormitzer said.,Pfizer and BioNTech disclosed preliminary Phase 1 data on 45 U.S. adult volunteers on July 1, showing one version of the vaccine - called B1 for short - appeared to be safe. Scientists noticed then that the vaccine appeared to induce antibody production exceeding that in people who recovered on their own from COVID-19.,On July 20, the companies' German trial indicated for the first time that the vaccine also induced production of T-cells that are thought to be important in activating an immune response against the coronavirus.,The two companies believed they were ready to test this candidate in a clinical trial that would ultimately enroll 44,000 people in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, South Africa and Turkey.,But on July 24, just days before they were scheduled to start the crucial trial, data on a different candidate called B2 became available. That version turned out to produce a similar immune response to B1, but had fewer side effects in older adults.,The researchers pivoted quickly to B2.,Work proceeded so fast that some researchers went weeks without seeing their families. Dormitzer hasn't seen his wife and kids since March, apart from Zoom calls.,""The urgency, the coordination, the intensity, I've never felt it more strongly … there is no downtime,"" said Dr. Pei-Yong Shi of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, who developed a new method to test the strength of the antibodies generated by the vaccine.,At the same time, hundreds of workers at the Pfizer research center in Pearl River, New York, were held to rigorous coronavirus prevention protocols: They couldn't touch door handles so all doors were propped open. They had to list everyone they came into contact with every day so that if anyone got sick, they'd have a map of potential exposures.,As the late-stage trial quickly enrolled volunteers, Pfizer's Bourla announced that efficacy data could come as early as October. It took a little longer - but not by much.,On November 9, based on results from a total of 94 infections, Pfizer made its bombshell announcement. Dormitzer says he only learned the apparent efficacy of the vaccine hours before the public did.,""I don't think any of us expected to see greater than 90% efficacy,"" Dormitzer said, adding that the FDA had specified a goal of at least 50%.,Karikó said she never had any doubt the vaccine would work. ""We could see the high level of cellular immune responses,"" she said. ""I was not nervous. I was so confident.""",Race for a cure,2020-11-17,How two companies sprinted ahead in extraordinary race for a COVID vaccine
"Home Depot's blue-chip stock, up 28% this year, fell 2.5% in early trading, despite the company beating quarterly sales and profit estimates.,Demand for home improvement products have remained elevated since coronavirus lockdowns started in March, as Americans spending more time at home due to limited options for travel or leisure activities use their discretionary income on minor home remodeling and repair work.,The heavy activity has, however, also led Home Depot to spend $1.7 billion in temporary pay and benefits for staff working through the health crisis. The company said on Tuesday it will change some of those benefits to permanent wage increases for frontline hourly employees.,A strengthening U.S. housing market, owed in part to record low mortgage rates, also encouraged customers to invest more in their homes, Home Depot said, signaling strong sales in the holiday season.,The company posted a 24.1% rise in same-store sales for the third quarter ended Nov. 1, beating analysts' average estimate of a 14.8% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.,Home Depot earned $3.18 per share on net sales of $33.54 billion, while analysts had expected a profit of $3.06 per share on net sales of $32.04 billion.",Business News,2020-11-17,Home Depot boosts staff pay by $1 billion after uninterrupted sales surge

"The vaccines, both developed with new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA), represent powerful tools to fight a pandemic that has infected 54 million people worldwide and killed 1.3 million.,Unlike Pfizer's vaccine, Moderna's shot can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, which should make it easier to distribute, a critical factor as COVID-19 cases are soaring, hitting new records in the United States and pushing some European countries back into lockdowns.,""We are going to have a vaccine that can stop COVID-19,"" Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in a telephone interview.,Moderna's interim analysis was based on 95 infections among trial participants who received the vaccine or a placebo. Only five infections occurred in volunteers who received the vaccine mRNA-1273, which is administered in two shots 28 days apart.,""The vaccine is really the light at the end of the tunnel,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert said. He urged Americans not to let their guard down and to continue washing hands and being vigilant about social distancing.,Even with fast authorization, the vaccines will not come in time for most people celebrating the U.S. Thanksgiving and end-of-year holidays, when families and friends come together - just the types of gatherings public health officials warn against.,Moderna expects to have enough safety data required for U.S. authorization in the next week or so and expects to file for emergency use authorization (EUA) in the coming weeks.,(For graphic on U.S. biotech shares: ),Moderna's data provide further validation of the promising but previously unproven mRNA platform, which turns the human body into a vaccine factory by coaxing cells to make virus proteins that the immune system sees as a threat and attacks.,Moderna expects the vaccine to be stable at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 48°F) for 30 days and it can be stored for up to 6 months at -20C.,Pfizer's vaccine must be shipped and stored at -70C, the sort of temperature typical of an Antarctic winter. It can be stored for up to five days at standard refrigerator temperatures, or for up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box.,The data from Moderna's trial involving 30,000 volunteers also showed the vaccine prevented cases of severe COVID-19, a question that still remains with the Pfizer vaccine. Of the 95 cases in Moderna's trial, 11 were severe and all 11 occurred among volunteers who got the placebo.,Moderna, part of the U.S. government's Operation Warp Speed program, expects to produce about 20 million doses for the United States this year, millions of which the company has already made and is ready to ship if it gets FDA authorization.,""Assuming we get an emergency use authorization, we'll be ready to ship through Warp Speed almost in hours,"" Hoge said. ""So it could start being distributed instantly."",The 95 cases of COVID-19 included several key groups who are at increased risk for severe disease, including 15 cases in adults aged 65 and older and 20 in participants from racially diverse groups.,""We will need much more data and a full report or publication to see if the benefit is consistent across all groups, notably the elderly, but this is definitely encouraging progress, said Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.,The trials were designed to measure whether the vaccines stop people from getting sick rather than whether they prevent transmission, which remains to be tested.,""It is likely that vaccines that prevent symptomatic disease will reduce the duration and level of infectiousness, and thus reduce transmission, but we don't yet know if this effect will be large enough to make any meaningful difference to the spread of the virus within communities,"" said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh.,Most side effects were mild to moderate. A significant proportion of volunteers, however, experienced more severe aches and pains after taking the second dose, including about 10% who had fatigue severe enough to interfere with daily activities while another 9% had severe body aches. Most of these complaints were generally short-lived, Moderna said.,""These effects are what we would expect with a vaccine that is working and inducing a good immune response,"" said Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London.,The U.S. government, faced with the world's highest known number of COVID-19 cases, could have access next year to more than 1 billion doses from Moderna and Pfizer, more than needed for the country's 330 million residents.,The Trump Administration has mainly relied on the development of vaccines and treatments as its response to the pandemic. Moderna has received nearly $1 billion in research and development funding from the U.S. government and has a $1.5 billion deal for 100 million doses. The government has an option for another 400 million doses.,The company hopes to produce between 500 million and 1 billion doses in 2021, split between its U.S. and international manufacturing sites, depending in part on demand.,Other countries such as China and Russia have already begun vaccinations.

"PARIS (Reuters) - Air cargo operators may struggle to distribute new COVID-19 vaccines effectively unless pandemic travel restrictions are eased, global airlines cautioned on Monday.,The warning came in vaccine transport guidelines issued by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which is pushing governments to replace travel curbs and quarantines with testing.,""If borders remain closed, travel curtailed, fleets grounded and employees furloughed, the capacity to deliver life-saving vaccines will be very much compromised,"" the IATA document said.,Widespread grounding of passenger flights that normally carry 45% of global cargo in their holds has taken out capacity, thinning the air freight network and driving up prices.,Existing immunisation campaigns have struggled with the partial shutdown. The World Health Organisation and UNICEF ""have already reported severe difficulties in maintaining their planned vaccine programmes during the COVID-19 crisis due, in part, to limited air connectivity,"" IATA said.,Vaccines will need to be shipped to developing countries reliant on passenger services for cargo, IATA's head of cargo Glyn Hughes told Reuters. Even in industrialised states, vaccine dispersal may be a tighter bottleneck than production, requiring shipments to secondary airports on passenger jets.,In preparation for the challenge of mass vaccine distribution, governments should move to reopen key passenger routes backed by robust testing, the airline body argues.,""There are several more months for governments to go through the planning cycle,"" Hughes said, leaving enough time to ""get passenger networks safely resumed, looking at safe travel corridors (and) mutual acceptance of testing procedures.""",Aerospace and Defense,2020-11-16,"Travel restrictions challenge vaccine rollout, airlines warn"

"LONDON (Reuters) - Stock market bulls rejoicing at promising news on the COVID-19 vaccine and the prospect of a more predictable U.S. presidency may have another reason to celebrate: an anticipated surge in the net global supply of shares shows no sign of materialising.,A decade-long decline in the volume of new shares available to buy helped power history's longest bull run, but was expected to reverse as the pandemic forced companies to halt share buybacks and list equity instead to shore up balance sheets.,Indeed, total share offerings have surged, with more than $700 billion raised worldwide in January-September, according to Refinitiv. And share buybacks, long blamed for draining markets of investable equity, dropped sharply.,But countering those shifts were forecast-beating M&A volumes and debt-funded buyouts, both of which usually remove shares from circulation. If that boom continues - and signs are it will - the net equity supply decline may not ease just yet.,""At the start of this year, we all feared we would have a big increase in net equity supply because of the collapse in buybacks and the increase in equity offerings.

M&A at $2.9 trillion also defied expectations of collapse and are only a tenth below year-ago values.,(Graphic: Leveraged buyout volumes up 6% this year - ),That was also powered by a sharp fall in borrowing costs, including for the higher-yield debt used in leveraged buyouts, as central banks pumped in stimulus.,""Private equity deals are not going go away and companies with strong balance sheets will try to do deals as access to capital is there,"" said Richard Saldanha, a portfolio manager at Aviva Investors.,""The more confidence we get around vaccine efficacy, you will see more deals taking place, it gives companies confidence from a capital allocation perspective."",Moreover, he reckons that while IPO volumes will continue growing, the explosion in secondary listings by cash-hungry companies should abate.,What of buybacks which came under intense political and regulatory scrutiny even before the pandemic?,For years, the biggest buyers of U.S. shares were companies themselves - a trend that also spread to Asia and Europe - but global 2020 buyback volumes have fallen to around $250 billion, less than a third of 2019 levels, JPM data shows.,(Graphic: S&P 500 buybacks - ),Third-quarter S&P500 buybacks could amount to $100 billion, according to preliminary estimates by Howard Silverblatt, senior analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

It has recovered by focusing on listing homes away from cities that people want to rent during the pandemic.,Airbnb's revenue fell 18% in the third quarter to $1.34 billion from a year earlier, but it reported net profit of about $219 million, helped mainly by a clamp-down on costs. Its business took a bigger hit internationally than in the United States, reflecting the financial fallout of extensive lockdowns in Europe to contain the spread of the virus.,""The recovery in the second and third quarters of 2020 is attributable to the renewed ability and willingness for guests to travel, the resilience of our hosts, and relative strength of our business model,"" Airbnb said.,The listing would cap a blockbuster year for IPOs, as companies capitalize on a stock market rally in the second half of the year, fueled by monetary as well as fiscal stimulus in a bid to blunt the fallout of the pandemic.,Airbnb has not turned an annual profit since its launch in 2008, and warned this will likely also be the case this year despite it being profitable in the third quarter.

It said that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service informed it in September it owed $1.35 billion, plus penalties and interest, over the sale of international intellectual property to a subsidiary in 2013.

The absolute prerequisite for a COVID-19 vaccine is that it stops people becoming ill enough to require hospital treatment and stops people dying. The preliminary data reported here suggest that this vaccine – and by extension, the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine – will achieve this goal.,""The safety data also look promising. The side effects of vaccination appear to be in line with those typically seen for other adult vaccinations, including the seasonal influenza vaccination which is administered in many millions of doses every year.,""One important unknown is whether this vaccine, or any of the vaccines currently in trials, prevents disease transmission. It is likely that vaccines that prevent symptomatic disease will reduce the duration and level of infectiousness, and thus reduce transmission, but we don't yet know if this effect will be large enough to make any meaningful difference to the spread of the virus within communities.,""But, overall, this is excellent news.

This press release is more specific than that of others, in that it confirms the numbers in each group, which was able to be guessed at but to have it confirmed is helpful.,""The range of minor adverse effects reported are unsurprising and typical of almost any vaccine. These reactions tend to be local to where the injection was given and are rarely long-lasting or severe.,""Although they reported efficacy being over 94%, there is statistical uncertainty in this; but based on these data, the likely efficacy will be better than 85% which would be greater than most scientists would have expected.,""This is the first study to report on severe cases and, while uncertainty remains, the finding of no severe cases with the vaccine and 11 cases with placebo is very strong evidence that the vaccine prevents severe as well as mild disease. It is likely that convincing evidence in respect to deaths will probably only be obtained when the vaccine is in use.,""A wide range of people with illnesses and from minority groups were included in the trials as well as substantial numbers of older patients.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are weighing the chances the Federal Reserve will increase its purchases of U.S. government debt in coming weeks to counteract the economic fallout of a COVID-19 resurgence, an intervention that could reverse a recent rise in Treasury yields to multi-month highs.,News that two coronavirus vaccines proved highly effective in late-stage trials in recent days have stoked investors' appetite for risk, sending yields, which move inversely to bond prices, to their highest levels since March and U.S. stock markets to record highs.,Still, some investors believe that rising coronavirus cases may threaten the fragile U.S. economic recovery at a time when fiscal stimulus is likely to be delayed and widespread access to a vaccine remains months away. The United States recorded more than 1 million new COVID-19 cases last week.,That combination of negative factors could push the central bank to increase its support, some investors argue, even though asset purchases already stand at record levels and the Fed has not indicated it intends to raise them at its next two-day policy meeting, Dec. 15-16. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to speak Tuesday afternoon, and investors will be listening carefully for any insight into the Fed's thinking.,Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research and North America macro strategy at Standard Chartered, believes the Fed may surprise markets by increasing its asset purchases to $120 billion a month before the December meeting if it appears that rising COVID-19 cases are weighing on the economy.,The Fed has bought at least $80 billion a month since the start of the pandemic.,The Fed ""may feel like it needs to act, even if they expect the vaccine to come,"" Englander said. ""It looks like there will be a two- or three-month period before the vaccine is widely available that looks like it will be really, really painful."",The Fed may also be forced to adjust its Treasury purchases if the positive vaccine news pushes the 10-year yield above 1%, said Priya Misra, global head of rates strategy at TD Securities. Misra expects the Fed to continue to buy the same amount of Treasury debt, but believes it will increase the portion of longer-dated bonds it buys.,Rising yields are a potential problem for the Fed because they raise the cost of borrowing for companies and individuals, something that could threaten economic growth.,""I think if you break 1% on (10-year yields) in quick fashion, you could see the Fed do it before the December meeting,"" Misra said.,Analysts at JPMorgan on Monday said in a note that they expect the Fed to increase the average maturity of its Treasury holdings at its December meeting, which could push yields lower.,Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida in a speech Monday gave no direct indication that the central bank was on course to boost its purchases.

"ZURICH (Reuters) - At flavour maker Givaudan's innovation centre near Zurich, veteran chef Sam Brunschweiler serves up a lamb shawarma dish that looks and tastes appropriately meaty but is made from pea protein.,The Swiss company and competitors such as International Flavors & Fragrances and Symrise are vying to create the tastiest plant-based meat alternatives in a market that is growing fast on the back of consumer concerns about health, sustainability and animal welfare.,""A pea tastes like a pea. You put it in a burger, it's not exactly what you would expect,"" Givaudan's head of savoury flavours, Flavio Garofalo, told Reuters.,Givaudan analyses how fat, proteins, sugars and water in meat produce different flavours when heated because ""most of the flavour comes from the cooking"", Garofalo said.,Mimicking the conditions in a vessel with non-animal proteins, sugar and fat - and using less water for roasted and more for boiled flavours - allows specialists to re-create a meat taste without meat, he said, just as a strawberry flavour can be created from bananas and apples.,The market for plant-based meat analogues, dominated by U.S.-based Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods and global food group Nestle, is expected to be worth $27 billion by 2025, according to Euromonitor ,.,Stacy Pyett, who manages a protein programme at Wageningen University & Research, said flavour houses played a key role in creating tastier plant-based meat analogues.,Improving their nutritional profile, which typically has more salt but fewer vitamins and iron than meat, is also a challenge.,Pyett said research showed salt was easier to taste in a juicy sausage than in a dry one, an indication that enhancing juiciness in meat analogues might allow for reducing added salt.,Garofalo said Givaudan had created flavours that allowed cutting the salt content by 35-40% while keeping the taste.,The company has also developed a 'fat encapsulation' technology that preserves fat in plant-based burgers during cooking as in real meat. Normally with plant-based products, most of the fats melt and flow into the pan.,""Fat is present in meat in what we call fat cells. When the fat melts, it's inside a little capsule that only breaks at a certain temperature,"" Garofalo said.,The technology, which is awaiting a patent, would keep the fat inside the patty and make it juicier, allowing for a reduction in fat content of up to 75% and of calories by around 35%.,Chantelle Nicholson, a London-based chef who participated in Givaudan's Chef's Council on plant-based food last year, said the fat encapsulation technology was ""a huge breakthrough"" because fat gave flavour to meat and it was still difficult to get the same depth of flavour with plant-based alternatives.,For Givaudan's peers Symrise and IFF, too, plant-based meat substitutes are a priority.,Symrise said it was particularly important to use natural ingredients from sustainable sources because consumers cared about that. The German group has developed ProtiScan, a procedure allowing quick detection of off-tastes in food containing plant-based proteins.,U.S.-based IFF, which increased its plant-based footprint through a merger with Dupont Nutrition & Biosciences, said it was about to launch technologies that improve mouthfeel and texture and use new natural maskers.",Environment,2020-11-17,Tricking the taste buds: flavour makers rise to meaty challenge

"SAO PAULO/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. farmers sold freshly harvested soybeans directly off their combines for a profit as prices rose to a four-year high this autumn, a welcome change from the losses suffered during the U.S.-China trade war.,But the unusual surge came too late for many Brazilian farmers, on the opposite southern hemisphere growing cycle, who had already committed to selling their crops at much lower prices and may now seek to renegotiate contracts with buyers.,Brazil ran out of the oilseed earlier than usual this year. It has sold so much to China that in recent weeks local companies had to import soybeans - a rare event for the world's top exporter. Those imports included 30,000 tonnes from the United States. That is a tiny amount by global trading standards but the most U.S. soy Brazil has purchased since 1997.,Brazil had been the primary beneficiary of the U.S.-China dispute started by U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018 as China relied on South America for almost all its soybean needs. But global market forces are finally helping U.S. farmers.,After signing a ""Phase 1"" trade agreement in January, China started ramping up U.S. soybean purchases in the second half of the year, helping spur the largest late summer soybean price rally in 13 years.,U.S. farmers who waited for the harvest to start in September before selling their crops rather than committing them early were rewarded handsomely with sales straight from the fields to processors and elevators.,""For once it was the right thing ... Usually the best opportunities to sell for fall are March through June but the world came to an end in March,"" said Norway Center, South Dakota, farmer Jed Olbertson, referring to the sharp decline of commodity prices as the COVID-19 pandemic hit the western hemisphere.,'PROBLEMS WILL OCCUR',Brazilian farmers, who start harvesting in January, presold sold roughly half of their crop before August, according to grain group Aprosoja. The price differences expected at harvest evoke memories from the 2003/2004 season when they refused to deliver grains sold in advance.,Frederico Humberg, owner and chief executive of fast-growing trading house AgriBrasil, said that a majority of contracts have ""no guarantee"" that the grain will be delivered, as there is no pre-payment of the grains by buyers.,""If Chicago prices and the dollar continue to be at current levels, problems will occur,"" Humberg said. ""Come time to collect the beans, farmers may allege yields fell or some kind of weather problem in a bid to improve the terms of the grain sale done in advance."",Buyers from two large U.S. companies with operations in Brazil, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there is also a risk of non-delivery. Farmers presold their beans when the 60-kilogram bag was around 80 reais, they said, less than half of the 170 real ($31.26) current price level.,Soy prices in Brazil closely mirror Chicago, taking account local port premiums and freight prices. Soybean prices are holding around their highest in more than four years after the autumn rally, which was spurred by storms and dry weather in both the United States and Brazil, as well as strong exports.,Soy processing plants and meatpackers in Brazil, a top global meat supplier, face much higher costs for feed, fueling food inflation. The country even modified regulations on genetically modified soy to allow it to import additional soybeans from the United States.,Farmers will also face higher costs for imported seeds and fertilizer as Brazil's currency weakens against the dollar.,Brazilian farmers told Reuters they missed out on the rally, but noted selling part of their produce in advance is a classic way to lock in planting costs early on in the season.,""I am one of the most regretful farmers,"" said Cayron Giacomelli, a grower in Brazil's top grain state Mato Grosso. ""Nobody imagined, even in the best-case scenario, that we would have prices above 120 reais per bag for future delivery at this time of the year."",U.S. farmers, who have also received record subsidies from the government this year, are meanwhile counting their blessings after years of over supply and low prices saw them take on increasing debt and forced many out of the industry.,""Maybe it (soy) was going to go some more, maybe it wasn't but I'm going to pay some bills,"" said Paul Anderson, a farmer from Coleharbor, North Dakota.,($1 = 5.4380 reais)",Energy & Environment,2020-11-17,U.S. farmers celebrate soy price surge as Brazil misses out

"SEATTLE/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Boeing Co is set to win approval for its grounded 737 MAX this week, but chinks are appearing in the brand as the most traumatic chapter in the jetmaker's history overshadows the planes' original billing of superlative performance.,When it returns to the skies next month as expected after a nearly two-year safety review, the ""MAX"" name will still be officially in place. Some airlines, however, have begun to soft-pedal references to the aircraft following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.,Industry sources familiar with the branding say the name will likely be phased out over time as a strategy unfolds among airlines to de-emphasize the ""MAX"" label in favor of the formal names assigned to each variant, like ""737-7"" or ""737-8."",""You will see the MAX name used less frequently,"" one of the sources told Reuters. Another person involved in discussions over the marketing predicted the MAX name would gradually fade in coming years.,Boeing declined to comment.,The wavering support for the brand could be a setback for the company, which had unusually advertised a name as well as a model number, and urged airlines to ""Think MAX."" It also shows a potential sore point with airlines, who had invested promotional dollars in a name now seen as tarnished.,Brand Finance last year estimated the MAX's problems had wiped $7.5 billion off the value of Boeing's corporate image.,Anticipating this week's approval, American Airlines Group Inc plans to relaunch commercial MAX flights on Dec. 29 from Miami to New York City.,While passengers will see the MAX name on booking systems, they will not see it on safety cards in seat pockets, people familiar with the change told Reuters.,American said the change is not intended to hide the MAX brand and corresponds to a plan to standardize safety cards across its 737 fleet that began even before it took delivery of its first Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2017.,""This approach is consistent with other fleet types where we do not have different safety cards for sub-fleets,"" a spokeswoman said, noting a similar move with its A321 fleet.,American has vowed to be transparent with customers about the MAX and will offer other travel options if they don't want to fly the aircraft.,Originally conceived in 2011, the word ""MAX"" was only ever a marketing title for the latest 737. Removing it from the cards has no impact on safety. But the cabin is where airlines define their brand, planning every visual cue, and virtually nothing there happens by chance, airline marketing experts say.,Doubts over the name surfaced in August when a news release on a MAX order from Poland's Enter Air referred to it as the ""737-8."",Last week, Air Canada used the same designation in a news release on quarterly earnings, with ""MAX"" appearing only in footnotes - a change from the year-ago format. An Air Canada spokeswoman said the airline uses the term ""interchangeably."",While it is keeping the name, Boeing allows airlines to decide how they want to market the MAX. Even before the crashes, Ireland's Ryanair Holdings PLC had decided to refer to its specially designed version as the ""Gamechanger"" rather than ""MAX"".,""If Boeing's customers want it dropped, it will be dropped,"" a third source said, adding that some key ""customers are saying the name MAX is tainted."",Pressures on the once-unstoppable brand name for Boeing's fastest-selling jet highlight a delicate problem for airlines.,In the near-term, they must restore public trust in the aircraft, which calls for transparency about which plane is being used, something U.S. operators have pledged to enforce.,But the name has also drawn high-profile scepticism.,In April 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted, ""I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add some additional great features, & REBRAND the plane with a new name."",In January 2020, the chairman of Air Lease Corp, an influential buyer, said the ""damaged"" brand should be dropped.,Changing the name of a tarnished brand has been a well-proven strategy for companies seeking to move past crises.,""Some people will remember and give you grief in the short term, but you've broken the connection,"" said Paul Argenti, a professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business. ""Someone getting on the plane four years from now won't remember 'MAX.'"",The MAX's branding woes are all the more tricky for Boeing, as naming civilian jets is the exception rather than the rule.,While official nicknames are common for military jets like the F/A-18 ""Super Hornet,"" Boeing only gave its first nickname to a civilian jet with its 787 ""Dreamliner"" about a decade ago.,But for the MAX, it needed to pack a bigger punch in an all-out battle for market share against European rival Airbus SE.,In 2011, Boeing abandoned plans for an all-new jet and launched a quicker 737 MAX upgrade after being blindsided by a huge Airbus sale to American Airlines, the company now reopening MAX flights.,Boeing marketers came up with a name that ""ticked numerous boxes: max performance, max capacity, max range,"" said a person familiar with the discussions.,A promotional Boeing video using camera angles to give the impression of a vertical take-off - tagged ""Flown by Boeing test pilots.

Today it remains depressed, emblematic of a U.S. manufacturing economy that, for all its apparent resilience, has notable pockets of weakness.,Broad measures of manufacturing activity, such as the Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers' index, suggest the sector has snapped back from the springtime slump delivered by COVID-19. But the revival is uneven. The Federal Reserve reported Tuesday that while output by consumer goods producers has largely recovered to pre-pandemic levels, those who make things for other businesses have not.,Indeed, some U.S. factories are booming, and there are even shortages of some popular consumer goods. Americans stuck at home or hesitant to get on airplanes are snapping up trucks, appliances, recreational vehicles and boats.,But a large swath of the U.S. industrial economy consists of companies like Kirsh's - which sell goods to other companies -and many of those firms remain crimped by soft demand.,Caterpillar Inc, seen as an economy bellwether, reported sales fell by at least 20% in its three main businesses in the latest quarter, while 3M Co reported sales down in half of its business lines compared with a year ago. Aerospace giant Boeing Co is mired in a deep slump.,A new surge of COVID-19 across the Upper Midwest, where many of these companies have large operations, is the latest challenge.

These factories, which produce metal castings, are a good gauge for the health of the larger manufacturing sector.,Nine out of every 10 durable goods contain metal castings, which are made by pouring liquid metal into forms to create parts that are then trimmed and polished before they move on to other factories. While castings are found in many consumer goods, including cars and washing machines, a core use is metal parts that go into things like bulldozers, cranes and airplanes.,Kirsh estimates his sales will be down 11% this year - a decent result considering that at one point they were down by half. He has laid off a third of his 115 employees, a combination of hourly and salaried staff, and halted all capital projects.,His 12 largest customers, which include Caterpillar, Deere & Co, and engine-maker Cummins Inc, have curbed orders and given little indication of when orders might return to pre-covid levels, he said. One hopeful sign, he said, is a strong uptick in orders in recent weeks, led by Deere.,What makes this downturn so unsettling, said Kirsh, is its ""open-ended"" nature. ""Even in 2008 and 2009, after a certain point, you could see things start to turn. You knew things would get back to normal,"" he said. ""This is not a normal economic downturn."",Now he is struggling to ship the orders he does have because the virus has hit the foundry directly.,In September, one of his supervisors tested positive - after the supervisor spent time talking to 12 workers around the plant. Then the scheduler - another key employee - tested positive, which meant the shipping supervisor who works closely with her also had to quarantine.,At one point the foundry had 19 employees - about a quarter of their reduced workforce - either sick or in precautionary quarantine. That number is now down to just one. But Kirsh's calculations of how many workers he needs are complicated by figuring out a buffer to account for COVID-19-related absences.

Boeing has said the missing display represented no safety risk, an FAA official said in May 2019.,Pilots must undergo new simulator training, including training on multiple flight-deck alerts during unusual conditions, along with how to respond to a situation known as runaway stabilizer with timely pilot actions required.,Pilots must also get training for erroneous, high Angle of Attack malfunctions.,American Airlines expects to train some 1,700 of its 4,000 737 pilots in December with a one hour and 40 minute iPad course and a two-hour simulator session that will follow a one-hour briefing, the union representing its pilots said.,Boeing said it will separate 737 MAX wiring bundles, flagged by regulators as potentially dangerous, before the jet returns to service.,The jet's wiring raised the potential of a short circuit that, in certain remote circumstances, could lead to a crash if pilots did not react in time.,One industry source said the wiring separation was ""still continuing"" this week.,In February, Boeing said it found ""foreign object debris"" - an industrial term for rags, tools, metal shavings and other materials left behind by workers during production - in the fuel tanks of dozens of undelivered 737 MAX jets.,Boeing said it has inspected all of the stored aircraft and ""shared inspection recommendations and detailed instructions with customers storing their own airplanes.""",Aerospace and Defense,2020-11-18,Factbox: Key changes to Boeing's 737 MAX after fatal crashes

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Before William Barr became President Donald Trump's choice to lead the U.S. Department of Justice, he represented Caterpillar Inc, a Fortune 100 company, in a federal criminal investigation by the department.,Much was at stake for Caterpillar: Since 2018, the Internal Revenue Service has been demanding $2.3 billion in payments from the company in connection with the tax matters under criminal investigation. The company is contesting that finding.,A week after Barr was nominated for the job of attorney general, Justice officials in Washington told the investigative team in the active criminal probe of Caterpillar to take ""no further action"" in the case, according to an email written by one of the agents and reviewed by Reuters.,The decision, the email said, came from the Justice Department's Tax Division and the office of the deputy attorney general, who was then Rod Rosenstein.,""I was instructed on December 13, 2018,"" wrote the agent, Jason LeBeau, ""that the Tax Division and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General jointly came to the decision that no further action was to be taken on the matter until further notice."" LeBeau, an inspector general agent at the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, declined interview requests from Reuters.,Since then, a source close to the case says, the investigation has ""stalled."" The order to freeze the Caterpillar investigation has not been previously reported.,Reuters was unable to determine why Justice issued the ""no further action"" directive. It was not issued by Barr, as it came before he was confirmed. A Justice Department spokesperson said Barr recused himself from any Caterpillar discussions once he became attorney general, but declined further comment. Barr, in testimony during his confirmation hearings, said rules of legal privilege precluded him from discussing his work for the company.,Rosenstein, who left the government in May 2019, did not respond to a phone message and emails seeking comment. The IRS declined to comment about the case.,Caterpillar, for its part, has reported to investors that the grand jury investigation is ongoing. The company told Reuters the DOJ's Tax Division is reviewing the investigation. Caterpillar has said for years that it did nothing wrong.,Potential conflicts of interest, whether real or apparent, often arise when high-powered lawyers switch between private practice and government service. Bruce A. Green, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at Fordham Law School, said it is not unheard of for attorney generals to have clients who had business before the DOJ. He noted that in 2009, President Barack Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, recused himself from a case involving Swiss Bank UBS, a prior client.,But Green said he could not recall a case where agents were told to take no further action on a matter involving an incoming attorney general's former client without some kind of explanation. ""Why would you just stop?"" he asked.,A source familiar with the progress of the investigation, which is being conducted out of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of Illinois, said that since December 2018, ""it's slowed, it's stalled, it's languishing. Not a lot of action is being taken."" But the source stressed the probe is not technically closed, and couldn't be called ""dead."",The government's questions about Caterpillar's tax structure started with a whistleblower lawsuit in 2009 that laid out what it said was a complex ""tax dodge"" to route Caterpillar profits on parts sales through a company in Switzerland. Then, in 2014, the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations dug into the issue, and alleged the company adopted a sales strategy that ""shifted billions of dollars in profits away from the United States and into Switzerland, where Caterpillar had negotiated an effective corporate tax rate of 4% to 6%."" The Senate investigators quoted company insiders who said the system was structured for ""tax avoidance."",At the time, Caterpillar said the transactions, and tax strategy, were entirely legal. A Caterpillar vice president testified to the committee that having an offshore subsidiary collect profits and pay taxes was ""nothing more than the standard business operations and tax planning that any prudent multinational enterprise would employ."",The next year, a federal grand jury in Illinois launched a criminal investigation. In March 2017, federal agents raided three Caterpillar offices, wheeling out evidence in large black plastic boxes. In a report written for the government, a consultant for the investigators, Leslie Robinson, called the tax strategy ""fraudulent rather than negligent."",Two weeks after the raid, Caterpillar Chief Executive Jim Umpleby announced the hiring of Barr as company counsel. Barr would ""take a fresh look at Caterpillar's disputes with the government, get all the facts, and then help us bring these matters to proper resolution based on the merits."",Robinson, the investigative consultant who had questioned Caterpillar's tactics, told Reuters she met with Barr in May 2017, briefing him on why she thought the tax strategy was illegal, and to hear why the company thought it was not. Robinson said she would not discuss the meeting details or the basis for her conclusion in the government's report.,In November 2018, as the White House scanned potential lawyers to take the job of attorney general, Barr's name was among those floated. On December 7, the White House announced his selection. ""He was my first choice from day one,"" Trump said. Barr has emerged as one of Trump's most aggressive aides, most recently authorizing federal prosecutors to investigate the counting of votes in this month's presidential election, which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden.,In January 2019, Robinson, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, sent a note to FDIC agent LeBeau asking if the case was ""dead or progressing."" Robinson wrote, ""From a personal standpoint, it is a bit peculiar to have spent so much of my time and energy on something and then to have no idea if it will amount to anything concrete."",""Quite frankly I am somewhat in the dark as well,"" LeBeau replied. He said he had understood that a new U.S. attorney was in discussions with Caterpillar, but knew little more. ""I know the process is going incredibly slow."",This October, Robinson communicated again with the investigators. In emails reviewed by Reuters, she asked what had happened to the case, explaining that a Reuters reporter had inquired. That's when LeBeau explained, copying other agents and a prosecutor on the email, that they had been told to take no further action a week after Barr's nomination 20 months ago.,""We were given no additional explanation,"" he wrote.",Business News,2020-11-18,"Exclusive: U.S. investigators were told to take 'no further action' on Caterpillar, ex-client of Barr"

He also gave some credit to President Donald Trump for trying to balance trade relationships between the United States and China, but stopped short of calling Trump's hardline policies a success.,Trump signed a multibillion-dollar trade deal with China in January that cut some U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for Chinese pledges to purchase more American farm, energy and manufactured goods. The agreement also addressed some U.S. complaints about intellectual property practices.,The president's rhetoric on China has been severe at times, accusing the country of ripping off the United States and causing a pandemic he occasionally calls the ""Wuhan virus,"" referring to a Chinese city where the COVID-19 outbreak seems to have begun.,Chinese President Xi Jinping also has some work to do, Greenberg said, criticizing the leader for China's behavior toward countries in Southeast Asia. U.S. embassies in Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Cambodia have accused China of encroaching on others' sovereignty by, for example, using dams to hold back water from the Mekong River during a drought last year.,Trump ""did a great deal to run on an even track,"" Greenberg said.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Treasury yields rally to multi-month highs, some investors are gauging how a more sustained rise could impact equity markets.,Yields on the 10-year Treasury, which move inversely to bond prices, rose to a seven-month high of 0.97% in the past week on hopes that breakthroughs in the search for a COVID-19 vaccine would eventually translate to a boost in economic growth.,That's still low, by historical standards: yields are a full point below their levels at the start of January and below their 5-year average of 2.05%, according to Refinitiv data. The Federal Reserve has pledged to keep interest rates near historic lows for years to come in its bid to support growth, and past rallies in yields have faded in recent years.,Expectations that a vaccine against the coronavirus could fuel a broad economic revival, however, have also spurred bets that yields could continue edging higher. That could potentially weaken the case for holding shares that have become expensive during the S&P 500's 58% rally from its lows of the year.,""If growth turns out better than anybody thought, the bad news is that the Fed might not have as much control over the extended curve,"" said Ralph Segall, chief investment officer at firm Segall, Bryant & Hamill. ""That would probably cause stocks to pause."",Analysts at Goldman Sachs this week forecast Treasury yields will hit 1.3% by the end of next year and 1.7% by 2022. They also raised their forecast for the S&P to 4,100 by the middle of next year, a roughly 16% gain from recent levels.,For now, analysts believe yields have some way to go before they become an obstacle to further stock gains.,The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed by an average of 1.37% a month during rising rate environments when the yield 10-year Treasury remained at 3% or below, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at research firm CFRA.,The S&P 500 gained an average of 0.53% a month with yields above 3%, he said.,How quickly yields rise also matters, said Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist at Hightower Advisors.,A gradual increase as the economy improves allows companies time to roll over or refinance debt, while a sharp jump higher is more likely to shock the market, she said.,Technology stocks, which have led the market higher this year, could be the first sector to feel the weight of higher rates, said Segall.,Rates moving above 1.5% ""would suggest that growth was better than anybody thought"" and pull investors into more cyclical areas of the market while potentially dimming the allure of tech-related names, he said.,Investors next week will have their eyes on earnings reports and forecasts from U.S. retailers to gauge how consumer demand is faring in the worst public health crisis in decades. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a seven-month low last week, while consumer prices remained unchanged.,At the same time, Treasury yields are far from eclipsing the average 2.07% dividend yield of S&P 500 stocks.,Should yields grind higher, ""a lot of investors would still see dividend payers as attractive because their yields are so much higher"" than those offered by bonds while also offering capital gains, said Bill McMahon, chief investment officer for active strategies at Charles Schwab Investment Management.,Plenty of investors believe rates are unlikely to rise much further.,An upward trend in rates will not likely be sustained until there are signs that the pandemic is being contained, either through falling infection rates or the widespread availability of vaccines, said Margie Patel, senior portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Asset Management.,Until case counts fall, 10-year Treasuries are likely to remain in a trading range below 1.1%, she said.",Banks,2020-11-14,Wall Street Week Ahead: Stock investors cast wary eye on yield rally
"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Friday received a license from the U.S. government to sell 4G mobile phone chips to China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, an exemption to U.S. trade restrictions imposed amid rising tensions with China.,""We received a license for a number of products, which includes some 4G products,"" a Qualcomm spokeswoman told Reuters.,Qualcomm and all other American semiconductor companies were forced to stop selling to the Chinese technology firm in September after U.S. trade restrictions took effect.,The spokeswoman declined to comment on the specific 4G products Qualcomm can sell to Huawei but said they were related to mobile devices. Qualcomm has other license applications pending with the U.S. government, she said.,In the past Huawei was a relatively small chip customer for Qualcomm, which is the biggest supplier of mobile phone chips. Huawei used its own house-designed chips in its flagship handsets but used Qualcomm chips in lower-priced models.,Huawei's potential to design its own chips was thwarted in September by U.S. trade restrictions that blocked its access to chip design software and fabrication tools. Industry analysts believe Huawei's stockpile of chips purchased before the ban could run out early next year, crippling its smartphone business.,Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the Qualcomm license would have a ""limited impact"" because it covers only 4G chips while consumers are shifting to newer 5G devices. Rasgon said it is still unclear whether U.S. officials will grant Qualcomm licenses for 5G smartphone chips.,Representatives for Huawei and the U.S. Department of Commerce, which grants the licenses, declined to comment.,Other U.S. companies such as Micron Technology Inc were also stopped from selling to Huawei and have said they have applied for licenses. Intel Corp has also said it has a license to sell to Huawei.",APAC,2020-11-14,Qualcomm receives U.S. permission to sell 4G chips to Huawei in exception to ban
